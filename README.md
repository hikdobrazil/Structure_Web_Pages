# Structure Web Pages

A collection of HTML files demonstrating various web page structures and semantic HTML elements.

## 📁 Project Overview

This project contains example HTML files showcasing different structural components commonly used in web development. It serves as a reference for understanding HTML semantics and proper page organization.

## 🗂️ File Structure

```
Structure_Web_Pages/
├── framework.html      # Main page framework with articles and footer
├── header.html         # Header section with banner and headings
├── heading.html        # Various heading levels demonstration
├── nav.html           # Navigation examples (horizontal and vertical)
├── head banner.png    # Banner image for header
├── nav logo.png       # Logo image for navigation
├── file zip.zip       # Archive file (referenced in navigation)
└── README.md          # This file
```

## 📋 File Descriptions

### `framework.html`
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates a complete page structure
- **Features**:
  - Main content area with multiple articles
  - Footer with navigation links
  - Copyright information and contact details
  - Internal anchor links for navigation

### `header.html`
- **Purpose**: Shows header section implementation
- **Features**:
  - Banner image integration
  - Grouped headings using `<hgroup>`
  - Multiple topic sections (HTML, CSS)
  - Semantic header structure

### `heading.html`
- **Purpose**: Illustrates proper heading hierarchy
- **Features**:
  - Document structure with H1-H3 headings
  - Nested content organization
  - Article content sections

### `nav.html`
- **Purpose**: Navigation component examples
- **Features**:
  - Header with logo and site title
  - Horizontal navigation menu
  - Vertical sidebar navigation
  - External and internal link references

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates:

- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`)
- **Content Structure**: Organizing content with appropriate heading hierarchy
- **Navigation Patterns**: Both horizontal and vertical navigation implementations
- **Image Integration**: Including images with proper alt text and dimensions
- **Link Management**: Internal anchors and external file references
- **Accessibility**: Using semantic elements for better screen reader support

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hikdobrazil/Structure_Web_Pages.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Structure_Web_Pages
   ```

3. **Open HTML files in your browser:**
   - Double-click any `.html` file to open in your default browser
   - Or use a local server for better development experience

## 🌐 Usage

### Viewing the Files
- Open each HTML file individually in a web browser to see the different structural examples
- Use browser developer tools to inspect the HTML structure and understand the semantic organization

### Educational Use
- Study the different approaches to page structure
- Compare heading hierarchies and navigation patterns
- Understand the relationship between HTML structure and content organization

## 🔧 Technical Details

- **HTML Version**: HTML5
- **Semantic Elements Used**:
  - `<header>` - Page/section headers
  - `<nav>` - Navigation menus
  - `<main>` - Main content area
  - `<article>` - Standalone content pieces
  - `<footer>` - Page footer
  - `<hgroup>` - Heading groups
  - `<address>` - Contact information

## 📝 Notes

- Some files contain minor syntax issues that could be addressed for production use
- Images referenced (`head banner.png`, `nav logo.png`) should be present in the same directory
- Links in navigation may reference files not included in this repository

## 🤝 Contributing
